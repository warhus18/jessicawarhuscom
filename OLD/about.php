			<h2 class="intro">Hello! I’m Jess, a Philadelphia based lead designer and front-end developer.</h2>

			<p>I have over five years of professional experience working on both the technical 
			and creative aspects of projects. With a focus on the web, I combine front end 
			web development with graphic design and illustration skills, to create engaging and 
			aesthetically beautiful websites.</p>

			<p>As a designer, I strive to create simple solutions to complex visual problems. 
			And, with a deep curiosity about the psychology of design, I focus on the thought 
			process behind a user’s decisions in order to create a better and more intuitive 
			user experience.</p>

			<p>I’m an Arizona native and began my career in Phoenix after graduating from Arizona 
			State University with a degree in Graphic Design. Go Devils! However, looking for a city 
			with a bigger art culture and greater possibilities, I made the big move across the country 
			to Philadelphia.</p>
