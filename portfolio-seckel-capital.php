			<p>Seckel Capital is a financial services company that helps customers with mortgages, investments 
			and insurance. Before approaching us, the mortgage and investment sides of the business were individually 
			represented, while the insurance side wasn't represented on the web at all. The main goals of this 
			project were to connect all sides of the business and design a site with that was user-friendly, making the 
			financial industry approachable to the average person.</p>

			<p>All work was done at <a class="text-button" href="//brolik.com/" target="_blank">Brolik</a> 
			under the creative direction of Alex Caldwell.</p>

			<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>To begin the web design process, we collaborated with the client to create a sitemap and 
			wireframes for the new site. Since we were connecting the three services for the first time, it was 
			important to map everything out so we could build a cohesive site to represent the entire business.</p>

			<p>After the client approved the visual design, I worked with a back-end web developer to 
			build out the site using <strong>PHP, SASS</strong> and <strong>jQuery/Javascript</strong>. 
			I also worked to connect the front-end of the site to a <strong>MySQL</strong> database and build out a 
			client-side admin, a custom CMS built by Brolik.</p>
